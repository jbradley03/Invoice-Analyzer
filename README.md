# Invoice Analyser

A .NET 8.0 Web API that extracts data from a pdf of an user-submitted invoice PDF and returns it in JSON format. It uses the Azure AI Document Intelligence.

# Context

Built as a proof of concept project during my internship with Core Financial Systems as part of their research and development program.  

Initially prototyped with a React frontend but later adapted to ASP.NET Razor Pages to align with Core's existing ecosystem and deployment practices. Both versions are included in codebase but the deployed Razor Pages version is linked below.

You will need to provide a sample invoice PDF, which can be found online.
